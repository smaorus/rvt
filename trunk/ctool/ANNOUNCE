    Announcing cTool

    ctool is a free package, it takes the name of a file to parse as
    input, and returns a pointer to the parse tree generated; or
    NULL if there are errors, printing the errors to stderr.
    It is written using flex and bison.

    Notable features:

        All tokens remaining in the parse tree (some are eliminated)
        are marked with the line# and col# they originated at.

        Includes a scoped symbol table, and is basically
        ready-to-run. I include a small example that parses its
        input and attempts to print it back out as code.
    
        Lexer understands C++ style comments, giving a warning for
        '//*' and parsing it as ANSI/ISO C requires.
