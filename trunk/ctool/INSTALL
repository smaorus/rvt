  To compile the ctool example program, you should first edit the file:
    src/makefile

  Most of the things that might need to be changed should be near the
  top of the file.

  To try building, cd into src and type 'make' or 'make all'.

  This 'ctool' program is just an example of course, you would
  want to compile in the parts you want (everything except 'ctdemo.cpp')
  into your own executable.  By default, a library 'libct.a' is
  built in the src directory containing all the objects you would
  normally want.

  Please read the file README also.

  I hope you like it.
